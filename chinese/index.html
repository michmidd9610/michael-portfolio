	  <h1>My Journey Through Chinese</h1>
	  <h4>I did the Chinese Dual-Immersion program. This means that starting in first grade and into middle school, I would spend half the day learning various subjects in English, and the other half would be spent learning various topics in Chinese. I would have different teachers entirely for each part of the day and one half was entirely in Chinese, even in first grade.
