	  <h1>My Journey Through Chinese</h1>
//First paragraph
	  <h4>I did the Chinese Dual-Immersion program. This means that starting in first grade and into middle school, I would spend half the day learning various subjects in English, and the other half would be spent learning various topics in Chinese. I would have different teachers entirely for each part of the day and one half was entirely in Chinese, even in first grade.	  
	  </h4>
//Second paragraph
	  <h4>When I started in first grade, I could not understand a single word uttered by my Chinese teacher. When I would get in the car to go home, one of my parents would ask me what I learned. I would dejectedly reply that I learned nothing, which was only partially true. I learned one thing: that I did not understand Chinese. I did not understand much for several months. This taught me that learning a language proved more difficult than I had planned. It also taught me I needed to double my efforts to gain a grasp of Chinese.		  
	  </h4>
//Third paragraph
	  <h4>Every year, the subjects that were taught in Chinese and English would rotate. For the most part, science, math, and history were taught in chinese. I still only know the water cycle in Chinese!
