	  <p>My Journey Through Chinese</p>
\\First paragraph
	  <h4>I did the Chinese Dual-Immersion program. This means that starting in first grade and into middle school, I would spend half the day learning various subjects in English, and the other half would be spent learning various topics in Chinese. I would have different teachers entirely for each part of the day and one half was entirely in Chinese, even in first grade.	  
	  </p>
\\Second paragraph
	  <h4>When I started in first grade, I could not understand a single word uttered by my Chinese teacher. When I would get in the car to go home, one of my parents would ask me what I learned. I would dejectedly reply that I learned nothing, which was only partially true. I learned one thing: that I did not understand Chinese. I did not understand much for several months. This taught me that learning a language proved more difficult than I had planned. It also taught me I needed to double my efforts to gain a grasp of Chinese.		  
	  </p>
\\Third paragraph
	  <p>Every year, the subjects that were taught in Chinese and English would rotate. For the most part, science, math, and history were taught in chinese. I still only know the water cycle in Chinese!   
	  </p>
\\Fourth paragraph
	<p>An event which changed my perspective on how far I had come with my Chinese abilities happened the summer after second grade. I visited a gift shop in Chinatown of San Francisco. I asked one of the seemingly nice ladies in Chinese about one of the products she was selling. Her jaw dropped to the floor with amazement that this blonde white boy could speak chinese. She yelled to who I thought was her friend, “Hey, get over here! Come listen to this boy. His Mandarin is better than yours ever was. Your Mandarin is no good!” After more intense back and forth, my dad interrupted and told them of course I could speak Chinese- I was obviously Chinese! “Just look at him-definitely Chinese.” Of course they were not about to believe that. But when they asked me what a symbol was on the wall, I quickly replied “horse.” After a long pause my dad broke the silence by saying that I was “Chinese on the inside.” Finally this was something on which everyone there could readily agree.
	</p>
\\Fifth paragraph
	<p>This experience taught me I was better at Chinese than I realized; however, it humbled me in a sense that it was just the beginning of my journey of learning this difficult language, but taught me I could do hard things with effort on my part. Over the years I have learned about Chinese culture from my teachers, but have been inspired to explore some of these topics on my own like Chinese calligraphy and  folk music. Looking back at it, my journey had only just begun. I would like to continue my journey of learning, not just of the Chinese language, but of other disciplines that are offered at the university level. As the wise Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu would say, “ A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”
